              <h4><b>NEPAL</b></h4> 
            <p>Around 563 BC, the Buddha Siddhartha Gautama is believed to have been born at the site of Lumbini. His mother, Maya Devi, was a Koliyan princess married to Suddhodana. In the Shakyas tradition, a tribe of rice-farmers near the India-Nepal border, the pregnant Queen Maya left Kapilavastu for her father’s kingdom to give birth. However, in Buddhist tradition, Buddha was born underneath a sal tree in Lumbini during the journey. The original Maya Devi Temple was built during the Emperor Ashoka’s visit to Lumbini around 249 BC, using burnt bricks to safeguard the Nativity Sculpture and Marker Stone where Maya Devi had given birth.
